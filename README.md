### What is this repo for ...

That's a simple application for tracking issues on facebook repository. It's an exercise to interact with [Github graphql api](https://developer.github.com/v4/)

### Live preview

First of all, have a look on a [live preview](https://5dee4aba656ff000080de43b--thirsty-fermat-080b71.netlify.com/)

### How is that build

It's a quick and simple project using [materialUI](https://material-ui.com/) for the components interface. [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking, [react apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for interaction with the graphql API. 

And last but not least [graphql-codegen](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) for automatically generate the typescript type files based on the graphql API.
